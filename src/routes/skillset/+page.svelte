    As part of a smaller team, I have not just learned technical aspects of my
    position but many transversal aspects of how to run a company as well as the
    much required <i>soft skills</i>. These include good communication skills,
    working together with clients to bridge the gap between their business needs
    and the abilities that a Data Scientist offers, proficiency in spoken and
    written English aside through client interactions in the international space.
  </p>
  <p>
    One of the most important learnings of my professional career has been my
    experience at a startup such as Bedrock, since a small team also means you
    get to understand a lot of other core business areas that Data Scientists
    usually struggle to understand (finance, new business/commercial meetings,
    direct client relationships...). I have learned that solutions, either in
    data or other disciplines, must first be based on business information to
    accurately solve the problems at hand. The arbitrary use of technology is
    ill-advised, and an informed roadmap usually yields better results for a
    fraction of the effort, while purely technical developments that are not
    based on business needs will fall on deaf ears.
  </p>
  <p>
    I have also been in direct charge of client accounts, leading the technical
    process of understanding the needs of the client, designing the business
    plan, and developing the solutions together with my colleagues. Another
    important part of my experience has been researching, planning and attending
    new business meetings constantly, as in a small team all members must
    support both lead generation and conversion into projects. Through the use
    of the Service Design and Agile methodologies, I have grown professionally
    and I have gained a holistic view of a full project design and development,
    so I believe I have a broad view regarding the design and communication
    around technical projects.
