  <p>
    <br />Hi! My name is Manuel, and Iâ€™m a Data Scientist based in Spain. I was
    born in 1996 in northern Spain (in a little green place called Asturias)
    where I currently live at.
  </p>
  <p>
    As all kids do, I was fascinated from a young age about everything; the
    nagging kid that doesn't stop asking "but why?". Since I was mostly
    interested in science, the universe and similar topics, my parents decided
    to just buy me lots of scientific magazines for kids so I would shut up
    (spoiler: I didn't, I just asked even more stuff ðŸ˜…).
  </p>
  <p>
    No wonder I ended where I'm at with all of those things in my mind. I hold
    degrees in both Physics and Mathematics from the University of Oviedo.
    During my tenure, I worked on the analysis of data from the (quite recent at
    the time) LHC Run 2 at CERN in the search for dark matter candidates, where
    a mix of Physics, C++/Python and Statistics showed how these disciplines
    combine to provide great insights. On the maths side, I applied <i
      >fuzzy logic</i
    > to the statistical analysis of qualitative "unmeasurable" variables. Check
    out the papers here:

    I loved both particle physics and statistics; however, I quickly realized
    the life of a researcher was not for me, and I wanted to try my part in the
    private sector. Thus, I embarked on getting a Masterâ€™s Degree in Advanced
    Statistical Analysis in the University of Salamanca, where I started my
    first steps into the Big Data and Machine Learning world. Check it here:

    Afterwards, I got my first position at <a
      href="https://www.bedrockdbd.com"
      title="Bedrock - Humanised Intelligence">Bedrock</a
    >, a small Data Science consulting firm in Asturias, where I spent three
    years and later changed to a similar position in
    <a href="https://www.decidesoluciones.es" title="Decide4AI">Decide4AI</a>.

  <h2>And I also have a life outside of work ðŸ˜‰</h2>
  <p>
    Iâ€™m a curious person by nature, always trying to learn new things. This
    includes both on the ML/AI space, where each week it seems that the advances
    are leaps and bounds above what used to happen in the era pre-ChatGPT
    (honestly, I wish there was more mainstream material on other tasks such as
    CV or recommendation systems). Platforms such as <a
      href="https://alphasignal.ai/">Alpha Signal</a
    >
    are amazing to keep up to date with all the new things that are coming out daily!
  </p>
  <p>
    I also love programming, where I mostly use Python in my day-to-day job, but
    I have also used C++, JS, Go and Julia for smaller projects. I have also
    delved into embedded devices, IoT and microcontrollers; for example,
    interconnecting several devices using the MQTT protocol to deliver real-time
    sensor outputs to a physical LED dashboard for further analysis. Check all
    of these and more in the <a href="{base}/projects">projects</a> folder if you
    haven't yet!
  </p>
  <p>
    As a matter of fact, this website you're reading went through many
    revisions! When I started it I wanted to develop my Go skills and I built a
    working back-end with routing, however getting the front-end ready and <i
      >pretty</i
    >
    was kind of a pain. In the end I settled with Svelte since I love the slick designs,
    reactivity, and overall support of the community!
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm also a FOSS advocate, using Linux and open-source tools as much as I
    can. I have been daily driving Linux on my desktop for over a year now, and
    honestly it's been amazing coming from the <i>great</i> experience Windows is.
    Although I have hacked my way around the system and know a lot of it, right now
    I'm trying to deepen my knowledge.
  </p>
  <p>
    And yes, I have a laptop with Arch (btw). And yes, I am using NeoVim to
    develop my projects. Deal with it.
  </p>
  <p>

      But if you learn how to exit it, please let me know, I'm stuck in
      limbo...ðŸ¥²</small

  </p>
  <p>
    As a side note, I also love tennis, music (who doesn't?), sci-fi books
    (Brandon Sanderson is a genius), videogames (<a
      href="https://nobaraproject.org/">Linux PC</a
    > all the way!) and travelling when I have free time!
