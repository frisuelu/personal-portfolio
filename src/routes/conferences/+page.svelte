<p>
  I have participated in multiple university talks and conferences where I have
  had the opportunity to share my knowledge and experiences around data with
  both technical and young people interested in getting into the field of Data
  Science, as well as non-technical people that are trying to understand what
  data entails and how it will impact them (this goes doublefold for businesses
  trying to become data-driven).
