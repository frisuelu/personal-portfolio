            I have participated in multiple university talks and conferences
            where I have had the opportunity to share my knowledge and
            experiences around data with both technical and young people
            interested in getting into the field of Data Science, as well as
            non-technical people that are trying to understand what data entails
            and how it will impact them (this goes doublefold for businesses
            trying to become data-driven).
