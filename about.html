<div align="center" class="landing_title"><h1><b>About me</b></h1></div>
<div class="prose" align="center"><p><br>Hi! My name is Manuel, and I’m a Data Scientist based in Spain. I was
    born on November 8th, 1996 in northern Spain (in a little green place called
    Asturias) where I currently live at.
  </p>
  <p>As all kids do, I was fascinated from a young age about everything; the
    nagging kid that doesn&#39;t stop asking &quot;but why?&quot;. Since I was mostly
    interested in science, the universe and similar topics, my parents decided
    to just buy me lots of scientific magazines for kids so I would shut up
    (spoiler: I didn&#39;t, I just asked even more stuff 😅).
  </p>
  <p>No wonder I ended where I&#39;m at with all of those things in my mind. I hold
    degrees in both Physics and Mathematics from the University of Oviedo.
    During my tenure, I worked on the analysis of data from the (quite recent at
    the time) LHC Run 2 at CERN in the search for dark matter candidates, where
    a mix of Physics, C++/Python and Statistics showed how these disciplines
    combine to provide great insights. On the maths side, I applied <i>fuzzy logic</i> to the statistical analysis of qualitative &quot;unmeasurable&quot; variables. Check
    out the papers here:
  </p>
  <ul><li><a href="theses/TFGManuelSouto-2018_2019-Physics.pdf" download="TFGManuelSouto-2018_2019-Physics.pdf">Dark matter search associated with top quarks in the CMS experiment at
        LHC (CERN). <i>University of Oviedo, 2018-2019</i></a></li>
    <li><a href="theses/TFGManuelSouto-2018_2019-Maths.pdf" download="TFGManuelSouto-2018_2019-Maths.pdf">Fuzzy characterization of the distribution of a random variable.
        Applications. <i>University of Oviedo, 2018-2019</i></a></li></ul>
  <p>I loved both particle physics and statistics; however, I quickly realized
    the life of a researcher was not for me, and I wanted to try my part in the
    private sector. Thus, I embarked on getting a Master’s Degree in Advanced
    Statistical Analysis in the University of Salamanca, where I started my
    first steps into the Big Data and Machine Learning world. Check it here:
  </p>
  <ul><li><a href="theses/TFMManuelSouto-2019_2020-Stats.pdf" download="TFMManuelSouto-2019_2020-Stats.pdf">Text mining with open-source software: DtmVic &amp; IRaMuTeQ. Comparative
        study applied to climate change.
        <i>University of Salamanca, 2019-2020</i></a></li></ul>
  <p>Afterwards, I got my first position at <a href="https://www.bedrockdbd.com" title="Bedrock - Humanised Intelligence">Bedrock</a>, a small Data Science consulting firm in Asturias, where I have been
    working for almost three years now.
  </p>
  <h2>And I also have a life outside of work 😉</h2>
  <p>I’m a curious person by nature, always trying to learn new things. This
    includes both on the ML/AI space, where each week it seems that the advances
    are leaps and bounds above what used to happen in the era pre-ChatGPT
    (honestly, I wish there was more mainstream material on other tasks such as
    CV or recommendation systems). Platforms such as <a href="https://alphasignal.ai/">Alpha Signal</a>
    are amazing to keep up to date with all the new things that are coming out daily!
  </p>
  <p>I also love programming, where I mostly use Python in my day-to-day job, but
    I have also used C++, JS, Go and Julia for smaller projects. I have also
    delved into embedded devices, IoT and microcontrollers; for example,
    interconnecting several devices using the MQTT protocol to deliver real-time
    sensor outputs to a physical LED dashboard for further analysis. Check all
    of these and more in the <a href="/personal-portfolio/projects">projects</a> folder if you haven&#39;t
    yet!
  </p>
  <p>As a matter of fact, this website you&#39;re reading went through many
    revisions! When I started it I wanted to develop my Go skills and I built a
    working back-end with routing, however getting the front-end ready and <i>pretty</i>
    was kind of a pain. In the end I settled with Svelte since I love the slick designs,
    reactivity, and overall support of the community!
  </p>
  <p>I&#39;m also a FOSS advocate, using Linux and open-source tools as much as I
    can. I have been daily driving Linux on my desktop for over a year now, and
    honestly it&#39;s been amazing coming from the <i>great</i> experience Windows is.
    Although I have hacked my way around the system and know a lot of it, right now
    I&#39;m trying to deepen my knowledge.
  </p>
  <p>And yes, I have a laptop with Arch (btw). And yes, I am using NeoVim to
    develop my projects. Deal with it.
  </p>
  <p><small>But if you learn how to exit it, please let me know, I&#39;m stuck in
      limbo...🥲</small></p>
  <p>As a side note, I also love tennis, music (who doesn&#39;t?), sci-fi books
    (Brandon Sanderson is a genius), videogames (<a href="https://nobaraproject.org/">Linux PC</a> all the way!) and travelling when I have free time!
